# Selene

Selene is a project template to quickly set up LOVE2D to run moonscript instead of Lua.

MoonScript is much nicer than Lua and leafo has fixed a lot of things about Lua in making the language. 

# Installing

Just clone this repo and ensure the dependencies are installed:

1. [love2d](https://love2d.org/)
2. [moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)

That's it! The conf.lua and main.lua take care of everything else. 

The template also includes some recommended setups but they don't *have* to be used. Just my personal preferences.
